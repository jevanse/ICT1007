; Process 1 is starved and is made to wait until all the other processes have finished executing.
; Process 5, though requiring the least time to execute, has to wait for the larger processes 
; 		(i.e. P2, P3, P4) before getting the CPU, all because it arrived the last. If process 5 
;		was allowed to run before Process 2 instead, the waiting times and response times would 
;		have been shorter and more distributed.
